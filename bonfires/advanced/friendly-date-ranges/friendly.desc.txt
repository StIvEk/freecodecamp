Bonfire: Friendly Date Ranges
Difficulty:â€‰4/5
================================================================================

Implement a way of converting two dates into a more friendly date range that could be presented to a user.

It must not show any redundant information in the date range.

For example, if the year and month are the same then only the day range should be displayed.

Secondly, if the starting year is the current year, and the ending year can be inferred by the reader, the year should be omitted.

Input date is formatted as YYYY-MM-DD

assert.deepEqual(friendly(['2015-07-01', '2015-07-04']), ['July 1st','4th'], 'ending month should be omitted since it is already mentioned');
assert.deepEqual(friendly(['2015-12-01', '2016-02-03']), ['December 1st','February 3rd'], 'one month apart can be inferred it is the next year');
assert.deepEqual(friendly(['2015-12-01', '2017-02-03']), ['December 1st, 2015','February 3rd, 2017']);
assert.deepEqual(friendly(['2016-03-01', '2016-05-05']), ['March 1st','May 5th, 2016']);
assert.deepEqual(friendly(['2017-01-01', '2017-01-01']), ['January 1st, 2017'], 'since we do not duplicate only return once');
assert.deepEqual(friendly(['2022-09-05', '2023-09-04']), ['September 5th, 2022','September 4th, 2023']);
